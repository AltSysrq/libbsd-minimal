libbsd-minimal - Utility functions from BSD systems, compilable on Windows

This library provides useful functions commonly found on BSD systems,
and lacking on others like GNU systems, thus making it easier to port
projects with strong BSD origins, without needing to embed the same
code over and over again on each project.

This version is a fork of libbsd. It only includes parts not dependent on
system or C library characteristics. This version is hosted at

  <https://github.com/AltSysrq/libbsd-minimal>

libbsd-minimal and libbsd cannot be used or even installed together. The only
reason to ever use this version is if you need to (cross-)compile to a
non-POSIX system like Windows.

libbsd-minimal makes no attempt to be an "overlay", like libbsd does. If you
include the <bsd/string.h> file, you get *only* the libbsd-minimal-specific
functions, so you'll need to include <string.h> manually as well. In this
respect it is incompatible with libbsd, but this removes the need for compiler
support of #include_next.

Things like err which are expected to be partially provided by the host are
instead pulled in full from the FreeBSD 10 source. This means libbsd-minimal
might redefine host symbols.

libbsd-minimal pulls in FreeBSD 10's sysexits.h, since libbsd does not provide
one.

There is no <bsd/bsd.h>, since no program needing it as a compatibility layer
would include it anyway.

I do not know whether the headers work under MSVC. <bsd/sys/freebsd-cdefs.h>
could potentially cause problems. No attempt was made to make this usable as a
Windows DLL. It can only be used as a static library on that platform.
